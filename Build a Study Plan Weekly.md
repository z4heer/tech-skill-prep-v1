# Step 2: Build a Study Plan (Weekly) with Mind Mapping

---

## 1. List Your Core Topics

Start by identifying the main knowledge areas you need for your target roles:

- **Backend:** Java (Spring Boot), Python (Django/Flask), REST APIs, Testing
- **Frontend:** Angular, TypeScript/JavaScript, DOM, State Management
- **System Design & Architecture:** Design patterns, Microservices, Cloud, Security, Scalability
- **DevOps & Cloud:** Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, AWS/Azure/GCP basics
- **Behavioral:** STAR stories, leadership, communication, conflict resolution
- **Other:** Data structures & algorithms, coding interviews

---

## 2. Create Mind Maps for Each Topic

Mind maps help you visualize and organize sub-topics, dependencies, and your progress.

**How To:**
- Use pen & paper, whiteboard, or digital tools (Excalidraw, XMind, Miro, MindMeister).
- Place the core topic in the center; branch out to sub-topics and details.
- Example:  
  - “Java” → OOP, Collections, Streams, Spring Boot, Testing
  - “Angular” → Components, Services, Routing, RxJS, Forms, State Management

---

## 3. Assign Weekly Focus Areas

- Break your prep into 1–2 week "sprints," each focused on 1–2 major topics.
- Example 6-week plan:
  - Week 1: Java + Data Structures
  - Week 2: Python + Algorithms
  - Week 3: Angular (core concepts)
  - Week 4: System Design + Architecture
  - Week 5: DevOps & Cloud Basics
  - Week 6: Behavioral, Review & Mock Interviews

---

## 4. Schedule Regular Study Sessions

- Plan 3–5 sessions per week, 1–2 hours each.
- Mix on-screen (coding, video, digital mind maps) and off-screen (whiteboard, flashcards, mock interview aloud) activities.
- Use a planner, calendar, or digital reminders to stay consistent.

## 5. Example Mind Map (Text Format)

```
[Java]
  ├─ OOP
  ├─ Collections
  ├─ Streams & Lambdas
  ├─ Spring Boot
  ├─ REST APIs
  ├─ Testing (JUnit, Mockito)

[Angular]
  ├─ Components
  ├─ Services
  ├─ Routing
  ├─ RxJS
  ├─ Forms
  ├─ State Management

[System Design]
  ├─ High-level architecture
  ├─ Microservices vs Monolith
  ├─ Databases (SQL/NoSQL)
  ├─ Caching
  ├─ Cloud basics
  ├─ Security
```

## 6. Tips

- Keep mind maps visible for quick reference and motivation.
- Update mind maps weekly as you learn or identify weak points.
- Use color or icons to mark completed topics or areas needing more work.
