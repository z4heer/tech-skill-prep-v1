## 1. Map Core Areas to Weeks

| Week | Focus Area           | Skills/Technologies (from CSV)                                                                                      | Level         |
|------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 1    | Java & Spring Boot   | Java (OOP, Collections, Streams, Concurrency, JVM), Spring Boot (DI, REST, Security, Microservices, Reactive)       | Beginner–Adv  |
| 2    | Hibernate & SQL      | Hibernate (ORM, CRUD, HQL, Performance), Oracle SQL, PL/SQL, MySQL (Joins, Procedures, Tuning), MongoDB             | Beginner–Adv  |
| 3    | Angular & Frontend   | AngularJS (Controllers, Routing, Services, State Management), JS (ES6, Async Patterns), TS, HTML, CSS               | Beginner–Adv  |
| 4    | Tools & Dev Practices| Git/GitHub (clone, branching, GitOps), Jenkins, Postman/Swagger, Eclipse/VSCode/PyCharm, JIRA, Toad                 | Beginner–Adv  |
| 5    | Cloud & DevOps       | Docker, Google Cloud Pub/Sub, CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab, CircleCI, AWS/Azure DevOps, TeamCity)         | Beginner–Adv  |
| 6    | Project Mgmt/Certs   | Agile (Scrum), Jira, Sprint Planning, Scrum Master, Google Solution Architect Cert                                   | All           |

## 2. Example Mind Map Breakdown (use digital or paper tool)

- Java
  - Syntax → OOP basics → Collections → Streams → Concurrency → Design Patterns → JVM internals → Reflection → Performance Tuning
- Spring Boot
  - Dependency Injection → REST API → Actuator → Security → Microservices → Reactive Programming
- Angular
  - Controllers → Directives → Data Binding → Routing → Services → Dependency Injection → State Management (ngRx) → Performance Tuning
- CI/CD
  - Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab, CircleCI, AWS CodePipeline, Azure DevOps, TeamCity (start from basic setup, progress to advanced pipelines and integrations)

---

## 3. Assign Practice Tasks

- Each week:
  - Review CSV skills for the focus area (beginner → mid → advanced).
  - Add skills to your mind map for tracking.
  - Do hands-on: code, build, deploy, draw architectures, or setup pipelines for that week’s tech.
  - Make/check flashcards for terminology and concepts.
  - End with a recap and self-quiz.

---

## 4. Progression Example

- Start with beginner topics for each area.
- Once comfortable, move to mid-level (e.g., Spring Security, advanced SQL, Angular Routing).
- Then challenge yourself with advanced topics (e.g., Microservices Arch, JVM tuning, Docker + K8s, CI/CD for real projects).
- Mark skills as mastered in your mind map or planner.

---

## 5. Tips

- Rotate on-screen (coding, diagrams), off-screen (whiteboard, role-playing), and multi-modal (videos, podcasts, group study) methods.
- Update your study plan as you master or identify gaps.
- Use CSV as a checklist—tick off each skill or topic as you progress!
