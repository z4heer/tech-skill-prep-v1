- Celebrate milestones, both big and small (new job, solved a tough bug, completed a course).

### c) **Reward Yourself**
- Treat yourself when you hit a goal: favorite meal, day off, new tech gadget, or a fun outing.

## 4. Refresh Your Environment

---

## 5. Prevent Burnout

- Take breaks and schedule downtime.

## 6. Best Practices & Tips
