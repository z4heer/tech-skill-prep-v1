# Step 5: Test Yourself (Detailed Guide)

---

Self-testing is crucial for identifying knowledge gaps, building exam/interview stamina, and boosting confidence. This step provides structured ways to assess your readiness through quizzes, sample tests, mock scenarios, and real-world challenges.

---

## 1. Timed Coding Assessments

- **Simulate Real Interviews or Exams:**
  - Pick problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) or [Exercism](https://exercism.org/).
  - Set a strict timer (30–60 min per set or as per company standards).
  - Attempt problems without peeking at hints or prior solutions.
  - After time’s up, review both your own and optimal solutions.

## 2. Quizzes and Knowledge Checks

- **Use Flashcard Apps:**
  - [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/)
  - Regularly shuffle and test your technical_skills.csv flashcards.
- **Online Quizzes:**
  - [GeeksforGeeks Quizzes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quiz-corner-gq/)
  - [W3Schools Quizzes](https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/default.asp)
  - [Java Brains Quiz](https://www.javabrains.io/quiz)
- **Self-Generated Quizzes:**
  - Create your own quizzes from notes or mind maps and challenge a peer to co-test.

## 3. Mock Interviews (Technical, System Design, Behavioral)

- **Platforms:**  
  - [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/), [Interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/), [Gainlo](http://www.gainlo.co/)
- **Format:**
  - Schedule with peers or through online platforms.
  - Include all interview rounds (coding, system design, behavioral).
- **Record and Review:**
  - Record your sessions (most platforms allow this) for self-critique.

## 4. System Design “Whiteboard” Challenges

- **Practice under time constraints:**
  - Select a system (e.g., URL shortener, scalable chat app).
  - Set a 30–45 minute timer.
  - Draw out the architecture on a whiteboard or [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).
  - Present and explain your design as if to an interviewer.

## 5. Behavioral/STAR Story Rehearsal

- **Randomize Questions:**
  - Use [Big Interview’s Question Generator](https://biginterview.com/answer-builder/)
  - Or draw random questions from a jar of printed prompts.
- **Self-Record:**
  - Record yourself answering; review for clarity and confidence.

---

## 6. Certification & Sample Exams

- **Official Practice Exams:**
  - AWS, Azure, GCP, Scrum, etc. often offer sample tests.
  - Schedule and take these under exam-like conditions.
- **Reference:**
  - [AWS Sample Questions](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certification-prep/)
  - [Microsoft Practice Assessments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/practice-assessments/)

## 7. Analyze Results & Retest

- After each test, review errors and slow answers.
- Focus next week’s study sessions on weak spots.
- Retake the same or similar tests after a month to measure improvement.

---

## 8. Best Practices

- Mix question types and formats to reduce predictability.
- Simulate real interview/exam pressure—no “open book” unless specified.
- Track your scores and progress in a dedicated log or spreadsheet.
- Use mistakes as learning opportunities—don’t avoid retesting weak areas.
