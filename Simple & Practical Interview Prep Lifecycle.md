# Simple & Practical Interview Prep Lifecycle
_A long-term, repeatable process for Fullstack/Architect/Tech interviews_

---

## 1. Set Your Goal
- Pick your target role (e.g., Fullstack Java/Python, Angular, Architect).
- List the core skills and topics required (update as needed).

---

## 2. Build a Study Plan (Weekly)
- Divide topics: Backend, Frontend, System Design, DevOps, Behavioral.
- Assign focus areas to each week (e.g., Week 1: Java basics, Week 2: Angular, etc).
- Plan 3-5 study/practice sessions per week (1–2 hours each).

---

## 3. Prepare and Review Core Materials
- Collect key resources (books, docs, online courses, coding platforms).
- Bookmark main references (e.g., Spring docs, Angular docs, LeetCode, Grokking System Design).
- Keep a personal notes repo or journal for quick revision.

---

## 4. Practice Regularly
- Code daily or every other day (alternate Java, Python, algorithms, Angular).
- Build or refine one small project per month (end-to-end, real-world scenarios).
- System Design: Sketch and explain 1-2 systems per month.
- Behavioral: Write and practice 1–2 STAR stories per week.

---

## 5. Test Yourself
- Take mock interviews (with friends or platforms) every 2–4 weeks.
- Solve timed coding challenges (LeetCode, HackerRank).
- Present a system design to a peer or mentor, get feedback.

---

## 6. Track Progress & Reflect
- Check off topics as you gain confidence.
- Review mistakes and update notes with lessons learned.
- Adjust your plan monthly: double down on weak areas.

---

## 7. Update Resume, Projects, & Profiles
- Every 1–2 months, update your resume with new skills, projects, or certifications.
- Keep GitHub and LinkedIn profiles current.

---

## 8. Stay Current & Motivated
- Follow blogs, newsletters, or YouTube channels for tech updates.
- Join communities (Discord, Reddit, LinkedIn groups).
- Take breaks and celebrate small wins!

---

## 9. Ready for Interviews Anytime
- Keep a “cheat sheet” for last-minute review.
- Practice elevator pitch and common interview answers monthly.
- Book mock interviews before real ones.

---

### Tips
- Consistency beats cramming: small, regular sessions > huge last-minute pushes.
- Make the process enjoyable—alternate topics, reward yourself, collaborate.
- Keep refining your cycle based on experience.

_Repeat this cycle to stay sharp, confident, and always interview-ready!_
