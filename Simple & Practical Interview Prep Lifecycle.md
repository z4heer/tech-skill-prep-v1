# Simple & Practical Interview Prep Lifecycle  
_A long-term, repeatable process for Fullstack/Architect/Tech interviews (with mindset and visualization techniques)_

---

## 1. Set Your Goal & Visualize Success
- Define your target role (e.g., Fullstack Java/Python, Angular, Architect).
- **Visualization:**  
  - Each week, spend 5–10 minutes picturing yourself succeeding—acing interviews, explaining system designs, collaborating confidently.
  - Imagine positive outcomes and feelings after a successful interview.
- **Manifestation:**  
  - Write down affirmations and goals:  
    “I am mastering Java, Python, and Angular.”  
    “I am becoming a confident Solution Architect.”  
    “I am well-prepared and calm during interviews.”
  - Read them daily.

---

## 2. Build a Study Plan (Weekly) with Mind Mapping
- List core topics (Backend, Frontend, System Design, DevOps, Behavioral, etc).
- Create a **mind map** for each topic to visualize sub-skills, dependencies, and progress.
  - Tools: Pen & paper, Excalidraw, XMind, Miro, MindMeister.
- Assign weekly focus areas (e.g., Week 1: Java basics, Week 2: Angular, etc).
- Schedule 3–5 sessions per week (1–2 hours each).

---

## 3. Prepare and Review Core Materials
- Gather key resources, references, and practice platforms.
- Maintain a digital or physical notes repo for quick revision and concept mapping.
- Use your mind maps to track and review what you’ve covered.

---

## 4. Practice Regularly (with Mental Rehearsal)
- Code daily or every other day (Java, Python, algorithms, Angular).
- Build or improve one small project per month.
- **System Design:** Sketch and verbally walk through 1-2 systems per month.
- **Mental Rehearsal:**  
  - Before mock interviews or coding sessions, close your eyes and visualize yourself solving problems with clarity and confidence.
- Behavioral: Write/practice STAR stories weekly.

---

## 5. Test Yourself (Active Recall & Visualization)
- Take mock interviews every 2–4 weeks (with friends or online).
- Solve timed coding challenges.
- Present system designs to a peer or mentor; visualize yourself explaining diagrams confidently.
- Use mind maps to recall and connect concepts before tests/interviews.

---

## 6. Track Progress & Reflect (Manifest Growth)
- Check off topics/skills as you master them.
- Keep a “success journal” to note achievements, positive feedback, and lessons from mistakes.
- Monthly: Update mind maps and affirm your growth—“I am progressing steadily towards my goal.”

---

## 7. Update Resume, Projects, & Profiles
- Every 1–2 months, update:
  - Resume (with new skills/projects).
  - GitHub (clean up, document projects).
  - LinkedIn (new achievements, skills).

---

## 8. Stay Current & Motivated
- Follow blogs, newsletters, or YouTube for tech updates.
- Join communities for accountability and inspiration.
- Celebrate small wins—reward yourself for consistency.
- Practice gratitude and positive visualization to maintain motivation.

---

## 9. Ready for Interviews Anytime
- Keep a “cheat sheet” for last-minute review.
- Practice your elevator pitch and common Q&A monthly.
- Book a mock interview before real ones.
- **Night before interview:** Visualize a smooth, successful experience.

---

### Tips
- Consistency > cramming; regular, short sessions are best.
- Mind mapping helps see the big picture and connections.
- Visualization and manifestation build confidence and resilience.
- Adapt the process as you grow.
