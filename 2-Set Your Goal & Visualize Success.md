## 3. Visualization Script/Template

**How-To:**  
- Find a quiet spot, close your eyes, and try this script for 2–3 minutes:

> “I see myself entering the interview room (or joining the video call). I greet the panel confidently. When asked technical questions, I explain my thought process clearly, and when given a system design challenge, I sketch the architecture and explain my choices. I feel calm, prepared, and focused. The interviewers respond positively. I finish the interview smiling, feeling accomplished. Later, I receive an offer and am excited to join the new team.”

Repeat this weekly, or before any interview!
