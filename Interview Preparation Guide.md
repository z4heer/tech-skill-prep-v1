# Interview Preparation Guide  
## For Fullstack Java Developer & Tech Solution Architect

---

### 1. Understand the Roles

- **Fullstack Java Developer:**  
  - Expertise in backend (Java, Spring/Spring Boot), frontend (JS frameworks like React/Angular/Vue), REST APIs, SQL/NoSQL, and deployment.
- **Tech Solution Architect:**  
  - Designing scalable architectures, making technology choices, leading teams, cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP), DevOps, and communicating solutions to stakeholders.

---

### 2. Resume & Portfolio

- Tailor your resume for both development and architecture roles.
- Highlight:
  - End-to-end project delivery.
  - Architectural decisions and their business impact.
  - Modern tech stack experience (Spring Boot, Microservices, Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud).
- Update GitHub with:
  - Well-documented, real-world projects.
  - Architecture diagrams and READMEs.

### 3. Technical Foundation

#### Backend (Java)
- Core Java: OOP, Collections, Streams, Concurrency.
- Spring Framework: Boot, Data, Security, REST, MVC.
- Microservices: Design, communication (REST, gRPC), service discovery, API Gateway, resilience, security (JWT, OAuth2).
- Testing: JUnit, Mockito, Testcontainers.

#### Frontend
- JavaScript/TypeScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3.
- Frameworks: React or Angular (core concepts, state management, hooks/services, routing).
- Consuming REST APIs, authentication (JWT).

#### Databases
- SQL (Joins, Indexes, Transactions), ORM (Hibernate/JPA).
- NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis) basics.

#### DevOps & Cloud
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, pipelines.
- Docker: Creating Dockerfiles, docker-compose.
- Kubernetes: Pods, deployments, services, configs.
- Cloud: Core AWS/Azure/GCP services (EC2/VM, S3/Blob, RDS/SQL, IAM, VPC).
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/CloudFormation basics).

#### System Design & Architecture
- High-level design: Scalability, reliability, maintainability.
- Design patterns, SOLID, DRY, KISS principles.
- Event-driven architectures, messaging (Kafka/RabbitMQ).
- Security best practices.
- Trade-offs: Monolith vs. Microservices, SQL vs. NoSQL, Synchronous vs. Asynchronous.
- Ability to draw and explain architecture diagrams.

#### Soft Skills & Leadership
- Explaining technical concepts to non-tech people.
- Leading code/design reviews.
- Mentoring juniors, managing stakeholders.

### 4. Practice

#### Coding
- LeetCode/CodeSignal: Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, DP, OOP.
- Real-world Java problems (collections, concurrency).
- Frontend: Build a simple CRUD SPA using React/Angular.

#### System Design
- Practice system design interviews (Grokking the System Design Interview).
- Prepare to design:  
  - E-commerce backend  
  - Real-time chat app  
  - URL shortener  
  - Scalable REST API

#### Behavioral/Leadership
- STAR method for past experiences.
- Tell stories of resolving conflicts, making architectural decisions, leading teams.
